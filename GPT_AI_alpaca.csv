What is Elastic Net regularization?,What is Elastic Net regularization?,"Elastic Net regularization combines both L1 and L2 penalties to the loss function. The formula for Elastic Net is: Loss = Loss_original + λ1 * Σ|βi| + λ2 * Σβi^2, where λ1 and λ2 are the regularization parameters. Elastic Net addresses the limitations of L1 and L2 regularization by balancing their effects, making it useful for situations where the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations or when predictors are highly correlated."
What is the simplex method?,What is the simplex method in linear programming?,"The simplex method is an algorithm used to solve linear programming problems. It iteratively moves along the edges of the feasible region, defined by the constraints, to find the optimal solution at one of the vertices. The simplex method starts at an initial feasible solution and searches for an improved solution by moving to adjacent vertices with higher objective function values until no further improvement is possible. The algorithm is efficient for solving large-scale linear programming problems."
